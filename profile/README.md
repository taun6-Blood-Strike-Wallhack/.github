## 🧬 What is a Wallhack in Blood Strike?

A **wallhack**, also known as **ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)**, shows enemy players even when they’re behind walls, boxes, or objects. Instead of waiting for footsteps or relying on a UAV, you’ll see:

* 🔹 Player Outlines or Skeletons
* 🔹 Distance Indicators
* 🔹 HP & Name Tags
* 🔹 Loot Locations
* 🔹 Weapon ESP (optional)

No more getting third-partied. No more getting clapped from behind. With this cheat on, *you are the UAV*.
